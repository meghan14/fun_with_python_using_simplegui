# Guss the secret number!

* Press **Range 100** to initialize the number between 0-100.
* Press **Range 1000** to initialize the number between 0-1000.(This one is tough to crack, believe me!) 
* Enter the number that you think is the secret number. Remember, You have only 7 attempts to make the right guess.  
* After every attempt, the terminal hints you whether the number is "Higher" or "Lower" than the number you guessed. For example,for range of 100, if you guessed 67 and it says "Lower" that means the secret number is lower than 67, so try making a smaller guess between 0 - 67 next time. This way you can reach closer to the secret number every time.   

All the best!!!! :)
