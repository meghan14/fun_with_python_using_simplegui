# STOPWATCH: The Game

Press 'Start' to execute the timer and try to stop (Press 'Stop') at an 'integral' value to score points. Like stopping at 0:09.00 gives you 1 success point but 0:09.3 gives you 1 failed point. Remember, your score is displayed in the top right corner in the form of 'X/Y' , where Y= Total number of failed attempt and X = Total no. of successful attempt.

All the best!!!! :)
