## Fun with SimpleGUI in Python!
This repo contains fun games and programs developed in python3 using simplegui.  
You can run the games using Codeskulptor. Link to execute and instructions are mentioned in the README file for each folder. 
Feel free to stick around and explore. Hope you have fun!!! :) 

#### Notes about Codeskulptor:
* CodeSkulptor runs Python programs in your browser.
* Open the link and Click the upper left button to 'run' the code.
* CodeSkulptor runs in Chrome 18+, Firefox 11+, and Safari 6+.
* Some features may work in other browsers, but do not expect
* full functionality.  It does NOT run in Internet Explorer. 

## Instructions for Local Installation:
Even though the games/programs can be simulated through CodeSkulptor, however, if you want to install to run 
them in your local you need the following packages in Python 3:
1.  **SimpleGUICS2Pygame**:  It is primarily a standard Python (2 and 3) module reimplementing the SimpleGUI particular module of CodeSkulptor (a browser Python interpreter). Can be installed from commandline as below:

				`pip install SimpleGUICS2Pygame`
				
Reference: [https://pypi.org/project/SimpleGUICS2Pygame/]

2) **Pygame**: Pygame is a Python wrapper module for the SDL multimedia library. It contains python functions and classes that will allow you to use SDLâ€™s support for playing cdroms, audio and video output, and keyboard, mouse and joystick input. Can be installed from commandline as below:

					 `pip install pygame`
